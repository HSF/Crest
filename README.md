# Crest swagger generated server.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework as well as [Spring](http://spring.io)

## Installation
Use gradle 5 and java >= 8. Depending on the profile in use, you may need Oracle drivers.
```
gradle clean install
```

To run the server, you can either start an embedded tomcat via spring boot, or deploy a war file in an existing tomcat instance.
We provide the following commands as examples:

```
cd crestdb-web
$ gradle bootRun "-Dspring.profiles.active=prod" "-Dcrest.db.password=xxx"
```
or
```
$java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -Dcrest.db.password=xxx -jar crestdb-web/build/libs/crestdb-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
```
## Swagger
You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:8080/crestapi/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
