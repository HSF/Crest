#       RestSwagger  / Schemes  / Components / json

#### Author: L. Michel

## Description
- This folder contains the JSON serialization of all the flat components of the JSON messages shared by different modules of the FSC
- The reference serialization is always the JSON one.

## Usage
The JSON files must be compliant with the JSON schema standard
1. [Web site](http://json-schema.org/)
2. [Tutorial](https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/)

The conversion from JSON to YAML must be operated by hand. 
1. Some script sample are provided in /scripts
2. There are also lots of [converters](https://www.json2yaml.com/) on line
